# ES6 + TypeScript Workshop
###Quintor
#####RachÃ¨l Heimbach
This workshop serves as an introduction to the new ES6 features and TypeScript.

##Content
#####tsconfig.json
Options for the TypeScript compiler.

#####/app/
Contains all libs and source files.

#####/dist/ (distribution) 
Contains all libs and source files compiled and ready for use. (Will be deleted every time gulp builds!!!)

##Install
Clone repo and execute the following command:
- npm install

## Tools
### Gulp
Gulp provides this project with browser-sync for faster development and makes sure everything in the app folder ends up in the dist folder.
### Tasks
##### gulp serve
Compiles TypeScript, copies all src files to dist, watches for every file change and starts browser-sync.

##### gulp serve-no-ts
This task ignores TypeScript if you prefer your IDE compiling TypeScript. Gulp will copy the generated js files to the dist folder.

#### Run Gulp
##### IDE
If your IDE supports Gulp, you can execute commands from there.

In Webstorm: right click gulpfile.js -> Show Gulp Tasks.

##### Terminal/nodejs/cmd
Make sure gulp is globally install: 'npm install -g gulp'.

If you don't have gulp installed you can use npm: 'npm run gulp' || 'npm run gulp-no-ts'.

##### Alternative
If you're having difficulties with gulp you can let your IDE compile the files and serve the app folder in localhost.

## Assignment
Start migrating the application to TypeScript.
Tips:
- When migrating a service that is used all over the app it's best to write a declaration file for it first.
- Controllers can be migrated to TypeScript easily. Be aware that JS files still get copied, so it is possible
that your new TS output gets overridden by the old js. Change the extension of the file to prevent this.
- There are declaration files included for the Angular API. This means there's a type and autocompletion for
every Angular method.
- The fakeBackend module provides a $httpBackend that mocks responses for if you want to test $http.

GET     /clients        | Returns all clients without additional information
GET     /clients/:id    | Returns one single client including additional information.
POST    /clients        | Creates a new client.
PUT     /clients/:id    | Updates existing client.
DELETE  /clients/:id    | Deletes existing client.
