# ES6 + TypeScript Workshop
###Quintor
#####RachÃ¨l Heimbach

##Install
Clone repo and execute the following command:
- npm install

## Tools
### Gulp
Gulp provides this project with browser-sync for faster development and makes sure everything in the app map ends up in the dist folder.
### Tasks
##### gulp serve
Compiles TypeScript, copies all src files to dist, watches for every file change and starts browser-sync.

##### gulp serve-no-ts
Ignores TypeScript files so your IDE can compile TypeScript. Gulp will copy the js files generated by your IDE to the dist folder.

#### Run Gulp
##### IDE
If your IDE supports Gulp, you can execute commands from there.

In Webstorm: right click gulpfile.js -> Show Gulp Tasks.

##### Terminal/nodejs/cmd
Make sure gulp is globally install: 'npm install -g gulp'.

If you don't have gulp installed you can use npm: 'npm run gulp' || 'npm run gulp-no-ts'.

##### Alternative
If you're having difficulties with gulp you can let your IDE compile the files and serve the app folder in localhost.

##Content
#####tsconfig.json
Options for the TypeScript compiler.

#####/app/
Contains all libs and source files.

#####/dist/ (distribution) 
Contains all libs and source files compiled and ready for use. (Will be deleted every time gulp builds!!!)

##Assignments setup
###Assignment 1 Gulp
```
Take a look inside the gulpfile.js file at the 'ts-compile' task that takes care of the transpilation 
process. This tasks defines the sources files, pipes it through 'gulp-TypeScript' and places inside the
distribution folder.
```

### Assignment 2 System.js

_"Universal dynamic module loader - loads ES6 modules, AMD, CommonJS and global scripts in the browser and NodeJS. Works with both Traceur and Babel.
 Loads any module format with exact circular reference and binding support.
 Loads ES6 modules compiled into the System.register bundle format for production, maintaining circular references support.
 Supports RequireJS-style map, paths, bundles and global shims.
 Loader plugins allow loading assets through the module naming system such as CSS, JSON or images.
 Built on top of the ES6 Module Loader polyfill." - system.js_

Currently nothing is happening in our project. Inside the app.ts file is an alert saying everything worked out.
To get this alert to show up we have to tell System.js to start importing the transpiled files. We only have to
tell System.js the entry point of our application. After this System.js can import other files through imports in
the app.ts file.
```
Add the following piece of code to index.html AFTER the lib script tags. If you've done it correctly,
an alert will pop up in the browser which means that we're done with setting up System.js. 
```

```html
<script>
  /**
   *  System.js will add a .js extension to every import.
   *  On compiletime the IDE can find the appropriate ts files (app folder).
   *  On runtime the files are transpiled to js (dist folder).
   */
  System.config({
      defaultJSExtensions: true
  });
  System.import('./app').catch(
      console.error.bind(console)
  );
</script>
```

[System.config docs](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/config-api.md#packages)

##Assignments ES6
###Assignment 1 Classes
```javascript
class Example {
    value = 123;
    //...
}
```

```
Create a new directory called 'models' inside the /app/src/ directory and fill it with a person.ts file.
Create a Person class inside the person.ts file with the following variables:
- firstName
- lastName
- id
```
_This person file WILL be transpiled by gulp-TypeScript to js, but WILL NOT be included in the browser._

###Assignment 2 Importing/Exporting
####Regular import/export (0..n per file)
```javascript
export class Example {
    //...
}
```
System.js is currently unaware of person.ts's existence because none of its files (app.ts) is importing it.
Before person.ts can be imported it has to expose something to the outside world.
```
Export the person by inserting the 'export' keyword in front of the 'class' keyword.
Now person.ts exposes a person class ready to be imported by some other file.

When in app.ts, type Person and let autocompletion do the importing for you.
```
_If your IDE does not support this feature, you have to manually import it. The import paths are relative to the
location of the file that is doing the import._
```javascript
import {Person} from './models/person'; // './' is very important
import {Person as P} from './models/person'; // also possible
```

####Default import/export (0..1 per file)
```javascript
export default class Example {
    //...
}
```
Default exports are imported differently than regular imports. Since there is only one default export per file 
(if you define multiple, only the last will exported) the name doesn't matter.

```javascript
import Example from './example'; //<- Works
import RandomName from './example'; //<- Works
import {default as RandomName} from './example'; //<- Works
import RandomName, {Other} from './example'; //<- Works (let's assume Other is an exported class)
```

```
Think about using default keywords from now on. The person.ts file exports a Person class, this can be
transfered into a default export.
```

###Assignment 3 Playing with transpiling.
Now that we have 2 interacting files, we're going to have a look at the different possible outputs of the transpiling process.
process. 
```
Take a look at tsconfig's 'target' and 'module' attributes and check the dist folder javascript files content. 
Change the target and/or module attributes and execute the 'ts-compile' task and check the different JS output.

target: (output js version)
- es5
- es6 

module: 
- commonjs
- amd
- system 
```

###Assignment 4 Playing with new ES6 Features.
####Constructors
```javascript
class Example {
    foo;
    constructor(foo){
        this.foo = foo;
    }
}
var example = new Example('value');
```

```
Append the Person's constructor with 2 parameters, firstName and lastName.
var the constructor set its own values. Create a few persons (in app.ts) with different names and log them.
```

####Class methods + custom interpolation.
```javascript
class Example {
    constructor() {}
    foo() {
        return 'example';
    }
}
var example = new Example('value');
example.foo();
```

Let's create a toString method inside the person class that returns its first and last name.
In stead of appending some strings to each other, we want to use the new interpolation that uses `.
Inside these symbols we can put strings and values.

```javascript
var exampleText = 'someText';
var interpolation = `exampleText = ${exampleText}`;
```

####Default params.
```javascript
function Example(param = 1) {
    console.log(param) //1 if it's called without parameter.
}
```

```
Give the person a greet method that expects a name and will console 'Hello ${name}!'.
Imagine the person will say 'Hello nobody!' if we don't give it a name.
In stead of doing an undefined check we simply give the name param a default value of 'nobody'.
```

####Rest param.
```javascript
function example(...params) {
    return params.length;
}
example(1); //1
example(1, 2, 3, 4) //4
```

```
Create a greetManyPeople method that will iterate through a list of people and greet them by name.
Instead of expecting a list as param, we implement the rest param so we can chain parameters.
```

####Arrow functions (lambda's) + lexical this
```javascript
//problem ES5
function OuterScope () {
    this.value = 123;
    var innerScope = function () {
        console.log(this.value);
    };
    innerScope();//undefined
}
new OuterScope();

//solution ES5
function OuterScope () {
    this.value = 123;
    var self = this;
    var innerScope = function () {
        console.log(self.value);
    };
    innerScope();//123
}
new OuterScope();

//solution ES6
function OuterScope () {
    this.value = 123;
    var innerScope = () => {
        console.log(this.value);
    };
    innerScope();//123
}
new OuterScope();
```

As seen in the previous example, arrow scoping works differently than function scoping. The parent scope is kept by arrow
functions as opposed to functions that create a new scope. This is very handy for not having to declare 'var self = this'
all the time. Be aware that sometimes it is necessary to use a normal function so the 'this' does refer to the other scope
(think about using this inside an onload function of an image, 'this' should refer to the loading image, not the parent scope)

```
Play around with the new arrow function syntax and realize that 'function' will be redundend soon
(in most cases, not all).
```

#### let keyword.
```javascript
function varTest() {
  var x = 31;
  if (true) {
    var x = 71;  // same variable!
    console.log(x);  // 71
  }
  console.log(x);  // 71
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 31;
  if (true) {
    let x = 71;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 71
  }
  console.log(x);  // 31
}
```
Source: [Mozilla developer network let description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Block_scope_with_let)

"Many common problems in JavaScript are alleviated by using let, so you should use it instead of var whenever possible." - TypeScript

```
Replace all 'var' keywords with 'let' and use 'let' from now on.
```

#### const keyword
```javascript
const wontChange = 'Test';
wontChange = 'OtherTest'; //error

const willChange = {content: 'Test'};
willChange.content = 'OtherTest'; //ok
willChange = {content: 'OtherTest'}; //error
```

Const is the new JS equivalent to Java's final.
```
Implement a constant.
```

####Generators.
!!For generators the tsconfig.json target MUST be es6 since there is no alternative in es5.
```javascript
function* Example() { //Notice the * right after the method keyword, no this is not a typo.
    let index = 0;
    while(true)
        yield index++;
}
let example = Example();
console.log(example.next().value); //0
console.log(example.next().value); //1
console.log(example.next().value); //2
```

A completely new feature of ES6 is the generator method. Basically it's a method that can keep track of its own 
state. 

```
Create an id generator inside person.ts (above the Person class) and let it set the id of the
person in its constructor.

Make another generator in app.ts and change 'true' to a condition. Log something underneath 
the while loop to see when it gets called and how many times it gets called
```

###Assignment 5 Inheritance 
```javascript
class A {
    constructor() {
        this.id = 1;
    }
}
class B extends A {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }
}
```

Create a new file called client.ts inside the models directory. Inside the file create a Client class that extends from Person.
For now the client also expects a firstName and lastName, but in stead of setting the values it'll pass it to the Person
through a super call. 

##Assignments TypeScript
IMPORTANT
From this moment onwards keep track of your nodejs/cmd/terminal where the gulp task is running.
TypeScript errors won't always compile, this means the browser won't be updated as well!

###Assignment 1 Basic types
Take a look at the Person class. Even tho it's located inside a TypeScript file, we haven't touched any TypeScript yet.
The first thing we can do is adding types to all variables and methods (return types) inside Person, [here](https://www.Typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) is a link with some basic types.
After this is done, create a new person with a variable and check your IDE's auto completion. Now we know exactly
what's expected and get compile errors if we put in the wrong values.
```javascript
class Example {
    text:string;
    constructor(text:string) {
        this.text = text;
    }
    getNumber():number {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

###Assignment 2 Access modifiers

For the rest of the workshop, think about your Class variables/methods visibilities (public/private/protected). This will help
to optimise your auto completion and code structure.

####public

Public exposes instance members to the outside.
This means that these variables and methods can be accessed by other code.

```javascript
class Example {
    public foo:string;
    //foo:string; //same
}
let example = new Example();
example.foo //ok
example.foo = 'something'; //ok
```

####private

```javascript
class Example {
    private foo:string;
}
let example = new Example();
example.foo //error
example.foo = 'something'; //error

class ExampleChild extends Example {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.foo; //error
    }
}
```

In Java it's considered a good practice to make every single variable private and accessible through getters and setters.
In JavaScript this is also possible.
```javascript
class Example {
    private _foo; //The underscore is there to prevent namecollision with the get/set method name.
    get foo() {
        return this._foo;
    }
    set foo(foo) {
        this._foo = foo;
    }
}
let example = new Example();
example.foo //ok
example.foo = 'something'; //ok
example._foo //error
```

```
Make the id in Person private and rename it to _id. Inside the constructor set _id to the next value of 
the IdGenerator. Add a get method id that returns the _id. A set id method is unnecassary because we don't
want to let the outside world mess with the id.

Print the id of an instantiated Person and try to set its id.
```

####protected

```javascript
class Example {
    protected foo:string;
}
let example = new Example();
example.foo //error
example.foo = 'something'; //error

class ExampleChild extends Example {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.foo; //ok
    }
}
```

Protected variables/methods are private to the outside world, but can be called/modified by the instance itself or its subclasses.
So imagine that all people can ask questions, meaning only they can take initiative to ask something. A protected method 'ask' would be
the solution. Person will be able to ask a question just like every subclass (Client in this case).
Implement a protected 'ask' method that consoles a question and call it (from within the instance).

#### Set access modifiers inside the constructor "shortcut"
```javascript
class Example {
    public foo;
    constructor(foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
    }
}

//same as

class Example {
    public foo;
    constructor(public foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
    }
}
```


##Assignment 3 Abstract
###classes
```javascript
abstract class Example {
    
}
new Example() //error
```
Person is a very generic class and term. In applications we never talk about a person, we rather talk about clients, employees and
admins. Those types of people have something in common, they're people. We want to define a person, but never instantiate it 
because it only serves as a super class to other types of people.
```
Remove all Person instantiations and make Person abstract by inserting the 'abstract' keyword 
before the 'class' keyword. Don't forget to move the _id generator out of the constructor 
because abstract classes can't have constructors here. (It is possible to instantiate an 
abstract class if it has a constructor, this is probably a bug?).
```
###methods
```javascript
abstract class Example {
    abstract foo();
}
class NotAbstractClass extends Example { //error must implement a foo function.
    
}
```
Abstract methods are methods without a body that MUST be implemented by the subclass of the abstract class.
```
Since a Person will never have to greet another person, remove the body and add the 'abstract' 
keyword in front of it. The TypeScript compiler should complain about the Client class for not
having a greet method.
```
##Assignment 4 interfaces
Interfaces serve multiple purposes in TypeScript. As the Java equivalent of interfaces and 
(as you'll see in the next assignment) as a type.

```
Create a Dog class. We don't really need to implement it, we just need a different type of class.
When comparing a dog and a client, we can conlcude that they both are able to walk. This resemblence
is nog big enough to create a common superclass and can be solved by an interfcace. Create an interface
called IWalk that implements a walk():void method. Let the Client and Dog implement the IWalk interface.
Now it's possible to create a method that expects something that can walk and accepts a Client and a Dog
even though they are different classes.
```

##Assignment 5 Types
###Custom
```javascript
class Example {
    foo(item: {index:number, name: string}):void {}
}
```
While working in JavaScript you don't always want to make a class for passing some set of variables to a method.
In TypeScript it's possible to easily overcome this issue by specifying constructed parameter types inline.
```
Create a method with inline variaties of types.
```
Nobody likes duplicated code, so when you notice that a custom inline type is being reused, a simple solution would be
defining an interface with those properties. This interface will not necessarily be implemented by a class because it 
serves as a type.
```
Replace the previously created inline custom type with an interface type.
```

###Conflicting
```javascript
class Example {
    foo(obj:{}) {
        console.log(obj.name);//error
    }
}
new Example().foo({name:'test'});
```
Sometimes you know there's a certain variable available in an object, but TypeScript will not let you call it (because of
a different assigned type). To overcome this you either have to set the correct typ so the error goes away, or you cheat
and cast the object to a different type. In the end it's still JavaScript so this only affects compiletime. 

```javascript
class Example {
    foo(obj:{}) {
        let customTypedObj = <{name:string}>obj;
        console.log(customTypedObj.name);//compiles
        console.log((<{name:string}>obj).name);//compiles
        console.log((<any>obj).name);//compiles
    }
}
new Example().foo({name:'test'});
```
##Assignment 6 Enum
```javascript
enum EXAMPLE_ENUM {
    MON,
    TUE,
    WED
}
```
Enumerated types contain multiple values that can be used as fixed types for different purposes.

```
Create an enum called ACCESS_LEVELS and fill it with an ADMIN, CLIENT and ALL level. These values 
will be used for restricting calls in the next assignment.
```

##Assignment 7 Decorators
Decorators are like annotations and can be used to add meta data or behaviour to classes, methods, params and variables.
###Class decorators
```javascript
function Example(target:Object) {
    let className = target.name;
}
@Example
class ExampleClass {}

//or

function Example(DAY:EXAMPLE_ENUM) {
    return function (target:Function) {
        let name = target.name;
    } 
}
@Example(EXAMPLE_ENUM.MON)
class ExampleClass {}
```

```
Create a class decorator called GiveFullPermission that expects an ACCESS_LEVEL value.
Inside the decorator assign the incoming access level to the target.
```

###Method decorators
```javascript
function MyDecorator (target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<any>) { }
class Example {
    @MyDecorator
    foo() { }
}

//or

function MyDecorator (value:string) {
    return (target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<any>) { }
}
class Example {
    @MyDecorator('someValue')
    foo() { }
}
```
Method decorators can for example intercept behaviour and register calls.

```
To find out how a method decorator works, copy the following code snippet and decorate a
method of the Client. Call the decorated method, check the console and browse through the decorator 
to get an idea of what's happening.
```

```javascript
function LogInAndOut (target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<any>) {
    let className = target.constructor.name;
    //methodName == propertyKey;
    console.debug(`${className}.${propertyKey} is called`);

    let originalMethod = descriptor.value;
    descriptor.value = function (...args:any[]) {
        //before method call
        console.debug("The method args are: " + JSON.stringify(args));
        let result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
        //after method call
        console.debug("The return value is: " + result);
        return result;
    };
    return descriptor;
}
```

```
Create a Secured method decorator that doesn't execute and throws an error if the class's ACCESS_LEVEL 
doesn't equal to the current user's access level (except when it is all). We don't have a user, 
so just define a var user and assign it an ACCESS_LEVEL. Decorate a method of the client and call 
it with different combinations of access levels. 
```

###Param decorators
<<Decorate a param so it prints>>

##Assignment 8 Existing JavaScript (declaration files .d.ts)
If you have written a gigantic JavaScript library, you really don't want to rewrite the thing in TypeScript.
That's why declaration files exist.
```
Copy the following code snippet and past it into a JavaScript file (client.service.js) and add a script tag 
to the index.html. This file represents a piece of JavaScript that we don't want to rewrite in TypeScript 
(imagine it's from your library). The JS code is loaded, but your TypeScript files will not know of its
existence.
```

```javascript
function ClientService() {
    this.all = [];
    this.getAll = function() {
        return this.all;
    };
    this.getById = function (id) {
        for(let i = 0;i < this.all.length; i++) {
            if(this.all[i].id == id) {
                return this.all[i];
            }
        }
        return null;
    };
    this.add = function (client) {
        this.all.push(client)
    };
    this.delete = function (id) {
        for(let i = 0;i < this.all.length; i++) {
            if(this.all[i].id == id) {
                this.all.splice(i, 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    };
}
```

```
Create a ClientService declaration file (client.service.d.ts). Inside this file create an interface that
contains all values and methods (including proper types) of the JS ClientService. After this is done, we
have to declare the function so TypeScript will know it exists. Now we use external JavaScript code inside
the TypeScript scope.
```

```javascript
declare function ClientService():void;

// Usually your application should create a reference to the declaration file, but it seems to work
// without it (Webstorm 11).
/// <references path="./client.service.d.ts" />
```
